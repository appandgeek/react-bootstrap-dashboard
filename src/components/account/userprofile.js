            "Hello, In this digital generation where information can be easily obtained within seconds, business cards still have retained their importance in the achievement of increased business exposure and business sales. If your business already has a bunch of printed cards distributed to a number of potential customers and yet you do not see any improvement in your market reach, then itâ€™s high time to revamp your old business card. Take out your business card and look at it in an objective point of view. If you were the customer, would you want to keep the card, or throw it away",
